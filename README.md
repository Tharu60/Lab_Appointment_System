# Lab Appointment System

ABC Laboratories provides a range of services for patients who require medical tests. Currently, all the appointment details and test records are managed manually. The organization is planning to implement a web-based Lab Appointment System to improve their service and productivity. The proposed Lab Appointment System must help in registering information about patients who are planning to do the medical test and handles patientsâ€™ queries. A unique ID must be produced for each patient after registration. When the ID is created the patient will receive the appointment time and number to undergo the test accordingly.

The system should be able to manage and store test details that include information about the patient, test and test results, technicians, and the doctor who recommended the test. Patients can pay the bill by credit card and the receipt will be emailed to the patient. The patients must have the facility to download their current and previous lab reports. The system must be user-friendly and generate necessary reports to support operational and managerial decision-making.

## Features

- **User Roles:** The system differentiates access rights based on user roles including Patient, Admin, Receptionist, and Technician.
